# 1. Delete the `.example` file extension so the whole file name is simply `.env`.
# 2. Generate a key in a php file using php-encryption's `Key::createNewRandomKey()`: https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption/blob/master/docs/classes/Key.md#keycreatenewrandomkey
# 3. Store the key in a file at `C:\keyfile` (no file extension). (If on Linux, of course you'll need to store this file in a different directory. After doing so, change its filepath in `db.incl.php` accordingly.)
# 4. Encrypt your SERVER, USER, PASS, and DATABASE plaintext strings in a php file using php-encryption's `Crypto::encrypt($plaintext, Key $key, $raw_binary = false)`: https://github.com/defuse/php-encryption/blob/master/docs/classes/Crypto.md#cryptoencryptplaintext-key-key-raw_binary--false. (See `db.incl.php` to see how to load `C:\keyfile` into a variable.)
# 5. Store each of these encrypted values in the `.env`, replacing the existing `def000...` dummy values.
# 6. Move the `.env` file to the directory above the site's root directory.
